Cross validation of crisprs 
The whole project is to extract a CRISPR that comprises of REPEATS and SPACERS from a genome of bacteria. This is further documented in a master file that also includes detailed information about a particular genome. Further the REPEATS are encoded in various ways to be fed into a cross validation algorithm to learn the strand using the various feature learning.
